This repository contains all of the code used on my Monograph project. The "short_term_display.py" code gathers and displays the data live, while the "graph_maker.py" makes graphs according to the .csv files produced by the former program. 

The ARDUINO folder contains the code used in the microcontroller (ATMEGA328p). 

The Examples folder contains a few examples of the output of the programs. 

The Previous Work folder contains all the deprecated code that was phased out due to the changing nature of the project.


Thanks
Juan Pablo Arenas
